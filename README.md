### Ansible-dev environment

The aim of the project is to establish a robust and localized development environment utilizing Ansible and Docker. This environment will mirror a professional work setting, incorporating a dedicated security server (Bastion), automation through Ansible, a web server, and a data storage server. This configuration will simplify and secure development processes and serve as a blueprint for future projects at CC.

Docker containers:

1.Bastion (SSH jump server)
2.Ansible
3.Web server (Apache2/WordPress)
4.Database server (MariaDB)
